How to Use this Program :

The Project I've create is Student Information System which I called siscgb, My project is composed of basic function of CRUDE
(Create, Read, Update, Delete, Edit). The first thing you'll see when you open my project is the front page which composed of
the Menu. In the Menu, you have 5 options which is 1 (Student) - Register New Student, 2 (Student) - View Records,
3 (Teachers) - Modify Records, 4 (Admin) - Delete Records, 5 - Exit. In option 1 which is Register New Student it shows up the 
Sign-up form for new students which need to fill-up the Firstname, Lastname, Student Number, Course,  Year. In option 2 which 
is View Records it shows the basic view Information of the students information, In option 3 which is the Modify Records this 
option is for Faculty only, in this section where the Professor and Instructors input the students grade. In option 4  which is
the Delete Records where only Administrator can only Access, Administrator can remove the student records. Lastly the option 5,
this option is where you want to Exit the Program.
